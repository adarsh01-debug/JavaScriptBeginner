# JavaScriptBeginner
This repo consists of absolute beginner level JavaScript projects. I am new to this language and just trying to understand the working of this language.
PS- These more like one-day projects made to get out of that "frustrated lerner" phase.
Caution- The project websites built in this repo are NOT responsive as hardly any effort was made for UI and thus are best suitable for pc browsers.
